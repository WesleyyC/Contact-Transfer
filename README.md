As part of the Google CodeU program, we create Contact Transfer.

ContactTransfer is an easy way to  transfer contact information between to phones with a touch. 

We currently support phone number, email, and Facebook. With both QR and NFC capabilities, no matter if you are in the dark or in a remote area, you can count on CT to get you the information you need to keep in touch with new friends (i.e. THE guy or THE girl you just met).
